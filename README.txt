This code submission was built in Visual Studio 2017 using the .NET Framework 4.6.1, with no Nuget Packages.
All the program code is located in the main library, "GildedRoseKata" with the test library being "GildedRoseKata.Test"
The application can be run directly through the debugger or by pathing to "GildedRoseKata\bin\" in either Debug or Release
folder depending on the version built though Visual Studio. Upon running the application it will prompt for a file path
to the input file; this must be a direct path. If the file is not valid, the program will loop back and ask for another
file path. The same interaction applies to the output file path. Any lines in the file that do not contain valid data 
will return a "ITEM ERROR" in the file output.
